# Talkarr

A *arr style program for downloading talks from media.ccc.de.

## About

This project was started as a way to download talks because I was not able to go to 38c3.
It is also a way for keeping everything from the [**Fahrplan app**](https://github.com/EventFahrplan/EventFahrplan) favorite list.
