## Important Note on the state of the project

Right now, the project is still in its early stages. This means, not everything is implemented or works as expected.

That is why I would love to get some feedback on what you think about the project and what you would like to see implemented.

## Documentation

You can find the documentation for the project hosted at [wiki.talkarr.app](https://wiki.talkarr.app).

## Installation

You can find the installation instructions for the project hosted at [wiki.talkarr.app](https://wiki.talkarr.app/deployment/).

## About

This project was started as a way to download talks because I was not able to go to 38c3.
It is also a way for keeping everything from the [**Fahrplan app**](https://github.com/EventFahrplan/EventFahrplan) favorite list.

## Roadmap and Features

These are the features that will be implemented:

- [x] Allow the user to specify where the talks should be downloaded to (Root folder)
- [ ] Allow the user to manage the files and be able to delete or move them
- [ ] Import the favorite talks from the Fahrplan app

(These are just the "advanced" features. Basic things like downloading talks are not needed to be listed here.)


## Contributing

If you want to contribute to the project, feel free to fork the project and create a pull request! I will then review your changes and, if everything looks good, merge them into the master branch.
