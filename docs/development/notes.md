# Development Notes

Here are some notes on the development of the project.

## media.ccc.de API

For implementing the search, the api `https://api.media.ccc.de/public/events/search?q=<SEARCH>`will be used.

## Wording

Sometimes, the word "event" is used to refer to a talk. This is because the API from media.ccc.de is using the term "event", while I prefer to use "Talk".
